Guessing Game Project Overview

The guessing game tests your basic knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery. The game is simple, guess a number between 1-100. The app should respond and indicate if you are 'hot' or 'cold' based on how close you are to the number you are trying to guess.

In order to create this project you are going to need the following files:

HTML File
CSS File
JS File
TIP:The project requirements below are for the complete Guessing Game project. Focus only on creating the HTML/CSS. We will start Part 2 of the project during Part 2 of foundations where your Guessing Game will come to life using JavaScript! The HTML/CSS may change when you start adding JavaScript and jQuery to your Guessing Game in Part 2.
